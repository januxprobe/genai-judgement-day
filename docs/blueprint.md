# **App Name**: GenAI Judgment Day

## Core Features:

- Recruitment: Start the game by allowing webcam access and capturing a photo, styled with an 80s CRT scan-line overlay.
- Interactive Quiz: Present a series of multiple-choice questions, where each answer applies an additive, generative AI transformation to the user's photo based on the choice.
- AI Image Transformation: The AI image service acts as a tool applying additive thematic elements as the game progresses, influenced by 'Code' or 'Chaos' choices, affecting visual background transformations.
- Results and Lead Generation: Display the final transformed image, title, summary, and a form to collect the user's company email address.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon orange (#FF8C00) to represent 'Code', suggesting a clean, futuristic aesthetic.
- Background color: Black (#010511), heavily desaturated, providing a moody and futuristic base.
- Accent color: Neon yellow (#04D9FF), an analogous color to cyan, for 'Chaos', creating contrast and aggression.
- Font: 'VCR OSD Mono' (monospace) to reinforce the 80s retro aesthetic.
- Employ glowing neon effects for buttons and text to enhance the retro-futuristic vibe.
- Incorporate subtle glitch animations for transitions, fitting the game's 80s retrowave theme.
- Cards will be used to separate and organize the final image, verdict/summary, and email form on the results screen.
